This was the Final Project for Python Programming 2. The exact task was:

Create a GUI-based application that allows data to be added to either a database, an XML file, or a CSV file -- which one depends on user choice.

The GUI has text fields for the following fields: Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, and Pay Rate. There are also three buttons. One button will 
take the data in the text fields, create a record, and assign it to a database table (.db file). Another button will take the data in the textfields,
create an element and sub-elements from them, and assign the element to an XML document. The third button will take the data in the text fields
and assign them as a line in a CSV file. 

Your GUI should make use of the concepts presented in the lecture of lesson #9. Using a grid layout and padding to space the widgets on the GUI
is a more reasonable manner. Just for the heck of it, make your buttons colorful. Just don't make my eyes bleed when I have to grade your exercise. 

To simplify things, I recommend you create the database file, the XML file, and the CSV file before you write and test the code that adds records to them.

Side Note: The comment about the colors is funny considering that is my style. I did not do that though for this project.

Anyway, this was the first project, where I really felt like I created a nice looking application. I made sure to get the spacing to look nice and 
added some more fancy touches. I also added a status for the error handling and a reset button to clear the fields. I think my code could have been a bit
cleaner, but I was on vacation and wanted to finish my final early. The result was a marathon of two late nights of coding. GitHub doesn't do pictures so
you'll have to download and run it to see the GUI. I promise... It looks damn good!!! 

On another note. I was never taking Python Programming for any required degree, rather it was the popular language for the Raspberry Pi, which I planned
work with in the future. At the time I was very interested in the field of robotics. I still am. Just in my area, there really isn't a lot of opportunity
especially if you don't have at least a Bachelor's degree.
